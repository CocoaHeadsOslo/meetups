- Anders Svendal from Tight: "Oslo Bysykkel"

Anders is a full stack developer and proud half of Tight. His workday is all about making digital products for clients like Aftenposten, NSB and Oslo Bysykkel – with Ruby, JavaScript and Swift being the favorite tools of the trade.   

In 2016, Tight's focus has been all about Oslo Bysykkel, and bringing one of Oslo's most beloved services to the smartphone. In this talk, Anders will walk us through what it took to bring the app to life – diving into a hardware project for the first time with super high stakes and a really short timeframe.
